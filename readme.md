Knowledge Graph Workshop
=======

1-day workshop on knowledge graphs (KG). Learn both the theory and get hands-on experience building KGs

Overview
-----

Knowledge graphs (KGs) are one of the most powerful ways to organize information by modeling the complex relationships. KGs are used by leading tech companies (e.g. Google, Amazon, Meta, etc.) to build "magical" data-driven products for their users. Examples include making product recommendations and enabling semantic search.

This course will introduce learners to knowledge graphs and equip them with the ability to create knowledge graphs in Python. 


Objectives
-----------

By the end of this workshop, learners should be able to:

- Explain how knowledge graphs can automatically learn the structure of unstructured data.
- Define knowledge graphs terminology, such as nodes, edges, subjects, predicates, and objects.
- Build and apply knowledge graphs to text data.

------
